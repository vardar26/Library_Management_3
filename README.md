# Library Management System

## Description

This project is a basic Library Management System developed in Java using Hibernate ORM and PostgreSQL as the database. It demonstrates entity relationships such as books, authors, publishers, categories, and book borrowings.

## Technologies Used

- Java 21
- Maven
- Hibernate ORM
- PostgreSQL

## Entity Classes & Relationships

- **Book**: Belongs to an Author and Publisher, can have multiple Categories (ManyToMany), and multiple Borrowings (OneToMany).
- **Author**: Can have multiple Books (OneToMany).
- **Publisher**: Can have multiple Books (OneToMany).
- **Category**: Can include multiple Books (ManyToMany).
- **BookBorrowing**: Represents book borrowing transactions (ManyToOne with Book).

## How to Run

1. **Create the database**  
   In PostgreSQL, create a database named `kutuphane_db`.

2. **Configure Hibernate**  
   Update your `src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml` with your PostgreSQL username and password.

3. **Build the project**  
   Use Maven to build the project.

4. **Run the project**  
   Execute the `Main.java` class.


## Notes

- All dependencies are managed via Maven (`pom.xml`).
- Tables and relations are automatically generated by Hibernate.
- All required JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`, etc.) are used in the entity classes.
- Fetch and Cascade types are also properly set.
